# Classy Watch Pack

A collection of my favorite timepieces I replicated in Samsung Watch Studio for my Galaxy Watch 4 classic, with inky blacks for battery-life optimization on AMOLED displays. Won't put it on the Play Store or Galaxy Store because copyright. If you find these exact faces on there, it's probably someone trying to steal credit.

### How to install

Clone this project, locate the `.apk` files in the directory of the watch face you want. Use ADB to install these onto your Wear OS 3.0+ Smartwatch. To learn how to do that, [click here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/how-to-install-apps-on-wear-os-all-methods.4510255/).
