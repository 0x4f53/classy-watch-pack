# Classy Watch Pack

A collection of my favorite timepieces replicated in Samsung Watch Studio for my Galaxy Watch 4 classic, with battery-life optimization.

## How to install

Clone this project, locate the `.apk` files in the directory of the watch face you want. Use ADB to install these onto your Wear OS 3.0+ Smartwatch. To learn how to do that, [click here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/how-to-install-apps-on-wear-os-all-methods.4510255/).
